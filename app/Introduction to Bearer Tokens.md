# AngularJS Security Considerations
_`Introduction to Bearer Tokens`_
==

### Transcript

In this part of the course, we'll talk about bearer tokens. Cookies have traditionally been used for user authentication. So when we're on a web site and we need to authenticate ourselves, we often do so, and then the server sends back a cookie to maintain our state of being logged in. There's a better solution to using cookies for authentication, and that's using what are known as bearer tokens. Bearer tokens are normally used for API security, and bearer tokens are generally implemented by the server returning back to the client a bearer token through the header. We'll look at some examples of doing that in this course. Bearer tokens are supported on the server side since the server will return to the client a bearer token that the client can then use to maintain access to the server. So we'll look at some examples of creating bearer tokens, using them, and then using cookies with bearer tokens.
